           <h3>Programmer</h3>
           <p>When I was 8 years old, I hacked into my father's computer and took all of his passwords and printed them all out. When I showed him what I did, he was amazed and surprised with what I did. From then on, I've modified several games, wrote several programs including a simple python games through MIT App Inventor in middle school, a Smurf (only to prank some friends), ARP and MAC spoofer and some personal Cheat Engine tables.</p>

          <h3>Modifying</h3>
          <img class="cheat" src="images/cheat.png" alt="Cheat table">
          <p>I've been a gamer all my life but the thing that seperates me from most is that I love to mod. The first game that I modified was Borderlands 2 on the PS3. I used a save editor to make my characters over powered to get to the end game faster. Once I got a PC, I've modded majority of the games I play by using Cheat Engine. I would look for hex values by changing the value (Money, health, XP, etc) slightly to find the right hex value and then save that data and hex values into a table for whenever I play said game again. I've also jailbroke Iphones and Consoles. My favorite that I jailbroke would be the PSP Go, PS Vita and Xbox 360.</p>
